NAME
    File::chdir - a more sensible way to change directories

VERSION
    version 0.1009

SYNOPSIS
      use File::chdir;

      $CWD = "/foo/bar";     # now in /foo/bar
      {
          local $CWD = "/moo/baz";  # now in /moo/baz
          ...
      }

      # still in /foo/bar!

DESCRIPTION
    Perl's "chdir()" has the unfortunate problem of being very, very, very
    global. If any part of your program calls "chdir()" or if any library
    you use calls "chdir()", it changes the current working directory for
    the *whole* program.

    This sucks.

    File::chdir gives you an alternative, $CWD and @CWD. These two variables
    combine all the power of "chdir()", File::Spec and Cwd.

$CWD
    Use the $CWD variable instead of "chdir()" and Cwd.

        use File::chdir;
        $CWD = $dir;  # just like chdir($dir)!
        print $CWD;   # prints the current working directory

    It can be localized, and it does the right thing.

        $CWD = "/foo";      # it's /foo out here.
        {
            local $CWD = "/bar";  # /bar in here
        }
        # still /foo out here!

    $CWD always returns the absolute path in the native form for the
    operating system.

    $CWD and normal "chdir()" work together just fine.

@CWD
    @CWD represents the current working directory as an array, each
    directory in the path is an element of the array. This can often make
    the directory easier to manipulate, and you don't have to fumble with
    "File::Spec-"splitpath> and "File::Spec-"catdir> to make portable code.

      # Similar to chdir("/usr/local/src/perl")
      @CWD = qw(usr local src perl);

    pop, push, shift, unshift and splice all work. pop and push are probably
    the most useful.

      pop @CWD;                 # same as chdir(File::Spec->updir)
      push @CWD, 'some_dir'     # same as chdir('some_dir')

    @CWD and $CWD both work fine together.

    *NOTE* Due to a perl bug you can't localize @CWD. See "CAVEATS" for a
    work around.

EXAMPLES
    (We omit the "use File::chdir" from these examples for terseness)

    Here's $CWD instead of "chdir()":

        $CWD = 'foo';           # chdir('foo')

    and now instead of Cwd.

        print $CWD;             # use Cwd;  print Cwd::abs_path

    you can even do zsh style "cd foo bar"

        $CWD = '/usr/local/foo';
        $CWD =~ s/usr/var/;

    if you want to localize that, make sure you get the parens right

        {
            (local $CWD) =~ s/usr/var/;
            ...
        }

    It's most useful for writing polite subroutines which don't leave the
    program in some strange directory:

        sub foo {
            local $CWD = 'some/other/dir';
            ...do your work...
        }

    which is much simpler than the equivalent:

        sub foo {
            use Cwd;
            my $orig_dir = Cwd::getcwd;
            chdir('some/other/dir');

            ...do your work...

            chdir($orig_dir);
        }

    @CWD comes in handy when you want to start moving up and down the
    directory hierarchy in a cross-platform manner without having to use
    File::Spec.

        pop @CWD;                   # chdir(File::Spec->updir);
        push @CWD, 'some', 'dir'    # chdir(File::Spec->catdir(qw(some dir)));

    You can easily change your parent directory:

        # chdir from /some/dir/bar/moo to /some/dir/foo/moo
        $CWD[-2] = 'foo';

CAVEATS
  "local @CWD" does not work.
    "local @CWD" will not localize @CWD. This is a bug in Perl, you can't
    localize tied arrays. As a work around localizing $CWD will effectively
    localize @CWD.

        {
            local $CWD;
            pop @CWD;
            ...
        }

  Assigning to @CWD calls "chdir()" for each element
        @CWD = qw/a b c d/;

    Internally, Perl clears @CWD and assigns each element in turn. Thus,
    this code above will do this:

        chdir 'a';
        chdir 'a/b';
        chdir 'a/b/c';
        chdir 'a/b/c/d';

    Generally, avoid assigning to @CWD and just use push and pop instead.

  Volumes not handled
    There is currently no way to change the current volume via File::chdir.

NOTES
    $CWD returns the current directory using native path separators, i.e. \
    on Win32. This ensures that $CWD will compare correctly with directories
    created using File::Spec. For example:

        my $working_dir = File::Spec->catdir( $CWD, "foo" );
        $CWD = $working_dir;
        doing_stuff_might_chdir();
        is( $CWD, $working_dir, "back to original working_dir?" );

    Deleting the last item of @CWD will act like a pop. Deleting from the
    middle will throw an exception.

        delete @CWD[-1]; # OK
        delete @CWD[-2]; # Dies

    What should %CWD do? Something with volumes?

        # chdir to C:\Program Files\Sierra\Half Life ?
        $CWD{C} = '\\Program Files\\Sierra\\Half Life';

DIAGNOSTICS
    If an error is encountered when changing $CWD or @CWD, one of the
    following exceptions will be thrown:

    * ~Can't delete except at the end of @CWD~ * ~Failed to change directory
    to '$dir'~

HISTORY
    Michael wanted "local chdir" to work. p5p didn't. But it wasn't over!
    Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor? Hell, no!

    Abigail and/or Bryan Warnock suggested the $CWD thing (Michael forgets
    which). They were right.

    The "chdir()" override was eliminated in 0.04.

    David became co-maintainer with 0.06_01 to fix some chronic Win32 path
    bugs.

    As of 0.08, if changing $CWD or @CWD fails to change the directory, an
    error will be thrown.
